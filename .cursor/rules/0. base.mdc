I’ll expand each section with a tailored design explanation (why it “wows” the user + how it adapts responsively for desktop & mobile).
This will help you feed it directly into Cursor IDE with clarity on both aesthetic intent and UX feel.

BiMakas Landing Page – Section by Section with Design Rationale

1. Hero Section (Uygulama Ön Planda)

Content:

Başlık: “Profesyonel Bakım Ayağınıza Gelsin”

Alt Başlık: “Saç, sakal ve güzellik hizmetlerini dilediğiniz yerde alın.”

CTA: “Bekleme Listesine Katıl” (primary), “Daha Fazla Bilgi” (secondary)

App mockup center stage

Tailored Design Wow Effect:

The app mockup in the center makes the product the hero → users see the value instantly.

Coral CTA button gives energy, dark secondary button gives premium balance.

White spacious background conveys luxury minimalism.

Responsive Adaptation:

Desktop: Hero splits into two → left text + right app mockup (large).

Mobile: Text stacks above/below app mockup for smooth scrolling, buttons stretch full width for easy tapping.

2. Features Section (Özellikler)

Content:

4 features with icons: Anlık randevu, Harita, Güvenli ödeme, Yorumlar.

Tailored Design Wow Effect:

Features shown in soft beige rounded cards → approachable, human-centered.

Each card uses minimalist line icons (thin but elegant) → balances approachability with high-end luxury.

Responsive Adaptation:

Desktop: 4 features aligned horizontally in a grid (spaced evenly).

Mobile: Auto-stacks into a 2x2 grid or vertical list, icons remain large for clarity.

3. How It Works Section (Nasıl Çalışır?)

Content:

3 steps: Aç → Çağır → Şıklığın Keyfini Çıkar.

Tailored Design Wow Effect:

A timeline flow with numbered circles (1-2-3) and minimal illustrations → gives sense of simplicity + progression.

Coral highlights create visual guidance, making the process feel effortless.

Responsive Adaptation:

Desktop: Horizontal timeline with arrows.

Mobile: Vertical stacked timeline, each step with icon + text centered.

4. For Professionals Section (Profesyoneller İçin)

Content:

Başlık: “Kazancını Arttır, Müşteri Portföyünü Genişlet”

Sub: “BiMakas, salon dışı kazanç için yeni fırsatlar sunar.”

Tailored Design Wow Effect:

Uses a dark luxury background (#2E2E2E) with coral text highlights → conveys exclusivity.

Contrast signals that this part is for business growth, not end-users.

Responsive Adaptation:

Desktop: Left-aligned text + right-side illustration (professional with tools).

Mobile: Full-width centered text, background overlays with opacity to keep readability.

5. Testimonials Section (Yorumlar)

“Kuaförüm ayağıma geldi, dakikalar içinde hazırdım.” – Elif

Tailored Design Wow Effect:

Minimal testimonial cards with round user avatars.

Star ratings in coral → signals positivity and approachability.

Responsive Adaptation:

6. App Showcase Section (Mobil Uygulama)

Content:

Phone mockups (screens: booking, map, payment).
